# ✅ Feature Complete: CSV Report Shows "Not Interested" Users

## What You Asked For

> "is the csv report updated to show the users that clicked on 'not interested'"

## What Was Delivered

✅ **YES** - The CSV report is now updated with a comprehensive **Facilitator Skill Declarations** section that shows ALL users who marked modules as "Not Interested".

---

## Quick Overview

### Before
- CSV only showed skill levels for assignments that were made
- No visibility into which facilitators marked "Not Interested"
- Had to guess why facilitators weren't assigned

### After ✨
- CSV now includes a complete **Facilitator Skill Declarations** section
- Shows ALL facilitators × ALL modules matrix
- Clearly displays "No Interest" entries
- Also shows "Not Declared" for incomplete profiles

---

## Sample CSV Output

```csv
FACILITATOR SKILL DECLARATIONS
Facilitator Name,Email,Module,Skill Level
Alice Expert,alice@example.com,Python Workshop,Proficient
Alice Expert,alice@example.com,Java Lab,Proficient
Bob Smith,bob@example.com,Python Workshop,Proficient
Bob Smith,bob@example.com,Java Lab,No Interest          ← Visible!
Carol Johnson,carol@example.com,Python Workshop,Not Declared
Carol Johnson,carol@example.com,Java Lab,Have Some Skill
```

In this example, you can clearly see that **Bob marked Java Lab as "No Interest"**, which is why he won't be assigned to those sessions.
