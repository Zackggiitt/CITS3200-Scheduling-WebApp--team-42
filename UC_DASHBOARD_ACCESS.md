# Unit Coordinator Dashboard Access Guide

This guide explains how to access the unit coordinator dashboard in the main branch.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed
- Virtual environment activated (if using one)
- All dependencies installed (`pip install -r requirements.txt`)

## Quick Setup Process

### Step 1: Set Password for Test Coordinator

The test data script creates the coordinator user but doesn't set a password. You need to set one using the `add_admin.py` script:

```bash
python add_uc.py --email uc_demo@example.com --password your_password_here
```

**Recommended password:** `password123` (for easy testing)

### Step 2: Start the Application

```bash
python application.py
```

The application will start on `http://localhost:5001`

### Step 3: Access Unit Coordinator Dashboard

1. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:5001`
2. You'll be redirected to the login page
3. **Login credentials:**
   - **Email:** `uc_demo@example.com`
   - **Password:** `password123` (or whatever you set in Step 2)
   - **Role:** Select "Unit Coordinator" from the dropdown
4. Click "Login"
5. You'll be automatically redirected to the unit coordinator dashboard
