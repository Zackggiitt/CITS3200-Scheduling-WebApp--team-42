# Bulk Staffing Update Fix

## Problem

Users could not update bulk staffing settings multiple times on the same sessions. After the first update (e.g., from 1 lead + 0 support to 1 lead + 2 support), attempting a second update (e.g., to 2 lead + 2 support) would fail.

### Root Cause

The original logic in `unitcoordinator_routes.py` (line 4533) had a flawed condition:

```python
# OLD (BUGGY) CODE:
if not respect_overrides or (session.lead_staff_required == 1 and session.support_staff_required == 0):
    # Update session
```

**Problem**: This condition only allowed updates if:
- `respect_overrides` was `False`, OR
- The session had default values (1 lead, 0 support)

Once a session was updated from defaults, it could never be updated again (unless `respect_overrides` was unchecked).

### Example Failure Scenario

1. **Initial state**: All sessions at 1 lead + 0 support (default)
2. **First update**: Change to 1 lead + 2 support ✅ Works (sessions had default values)
3. **Second update**: Try to change to 2 lead + 2 support ❌ **FAILS**
   - Sessions now have (1 lead + 2 support), which is NOT the default (1 + 0)
   - With `respect_overrides=True`, the condition fails
   - Sessions are not updated

## Solution

### Backend Fix: `unitcoordinator_routes.py`

Updated the logic to properly handle the `respect_overrides` flag:

```python
# NEW (FIXED) CODE:
should_update = True

if respect_overrides:
    # Skip only if the session already has the exact values we're trying to set
    # This prevents redundant updates but allows changing to new values
    if (session.lead_staff_required == lead_staff_required and 
        session.support_staff_required == support_staff_required):
        should_update = False  # Already set to target values, skip
    # Otherwise, update (even if different from defaults)

if should_update:
    session.lead_staff_required = lead_staff_required
    session.support_staff_required = support_staff_required
    updated_count += 1
```

**New Logic**:
- **`respect_overrides = False`**: Always update all sessions (force update)
- **`respect_overrides = True`**: Skip sessions that already have the target values (efficiency), but still allow updates to different values

### Frontend Fix: `templates/unitcoordinator_dashboard.html`

1. **Unchecked by default**: Changed checkbox to be unchecked by default (more intuitive)
2. **Better label**: Updated label text for clarity

```html
<!-- OLD -->
<input type="checkbox" id="respect_overrides" checked class="mr-2">
<span class="text-sm text-gray-700">Respect overrides</span>

<!-- NEW -->
<input type="checkbox" id="respect_overrides" class="mr-2">
<span class="text-sm text-gray-700">Skip sessions already set to these values (prevents redundant updates)</span>
```

## Testing Results

Tested multiple sequential updates on the same sessions:

```
TEST 1: Initial State
  Sessions: 1 lead + 2 support

TEST 2: Update to 1 lead + 2 support
  Result: No change (already set) ✅

TEST 3: Update to 2 lead + 2 support
  Result: All updated successfully ✅

TEST 4: Update to 1 lead + 0 support (reset)
  Result: All updated successfully ✅

✅ SUCCESS: Bulk staffing can be updated multiple times!
```

## How It Works Now

### Scenario 1: Respect Overrides = Unchecked (Default)
```
Update from 1+2 to 2+2:
  → All sessions updated (no checks, force update)
```

### Scenario 2: Respect Overrides = Checked
```
Update from 1+2 to 2+2:
  → Check each session:
    - If already 2+2: Skip (no need to update)
    - If 1+2: Update to 2+2 ✅
  → Result: All 1+2 sessions become 2+2
```

### Scenario 3: Respect Overrides = Checked (Redundant Update)
```
Update from 2+2 to 2+2:
  → All sessions already at target values
  → All skipped (efficiency)
  → Message: "0 sessions updated" (correct!)
```

## Benefits

1. **Multiple Updates**: Can now update bulk staffing as many times as needed
2. **Flexible**: Works with any combination of lead/support values
3. **Efficient**: Optional "respect overrides" prevents redundant updates
4. **Intuitive**: Better default (unchecked) and clearer label
5. **No Data Loss**: Sessions can be updated without restrictions

## User Workflow

Users can now:
1. Set bulk staffing to 1 lead + 1 support
2. Later change to 1 lead + 2 support
3. Later change to 2 lead + 2 support
4. Later change back to 1 lead + 0 support
5. **Repeat as many times as needed** ✅
