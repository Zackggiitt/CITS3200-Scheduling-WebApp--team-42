# Verification Summary: NO_INTEREST Constraint

## ✅ VERIFICATION COMPLETE

Users marked as "Not Interested" in a given session **ARE NOT allocated** to that session, and this behavior **IS correctly represented** in the generated CSV report.

---

## Quick Test Results

### ✅ Unit Tests - ALL PASSED
```
Test 1: check_skill_constraint()          ✅ PASSED
Test 2: calculate_facilitator_score()     ✅ PASSED  
Test 3: SKILL_SCORES mapping              ✅ PASSED
```

### ✅ Integration Tests - ALL PASSED
```
- Alice (NO_INTEREST in Python): 0 Python assignments    ✅ CORRECT
- Bob (NO_INTEREST in Java): 0 Java assignments          ✅ CORRECT
- No constraint violations detected                      ✅ CORRECT
- CSV report shows accurate skill levels                 ✅ CORRECT
```

## How It Works

### 1. Hard Constraint Enforcement

The system enforces NO_INTEREST as a **hard constraint**:

```python
# Step 1: Check if facilitator has NO_INTEREST
if skill_level == SkillLevel.NO_INTEREST:
    return False  # Cannot be assigned

# Step 2: Set score to 0.0 (blocks assignment)
if not check_skill_constraint(facilitator, session):
    return 0.0  # Hard constraint violation

# Step 3: Only assign if score > 0
if best_score > 0:
    create_assignment(...)
```

**Result**: Facilitators with NO_INTEREST are **never** assigned to those sessions.

### 2. CSV Report Representation

The CSV report shows skill levels in **3 sections**:

#### Section 3: Skill Level Distribution
Shows aggregate count of "No Interest" assignments (should be 0)

#### Section 5: Per-Facilitator Breakdown  
Shows how many "No Interest" sessions each facilitator got (should be 0)

#### Section 7: Detailed Assignments
Shows skill level for each assignment (never "No Interest")

## How to Verify Yourself

### Option 1: Run Unit Tests
```bash
cd /Users/izzy/Documents/GitHub/CITS3200-Scheduling-WebApp--team-42
source venv/bin/activate
python test_no_interest_constraint.py
```

### Option 2: Run Integration Tests
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
python test_no_interest_integration.py
```

### Option 3: Manual Testing
1. Create a test unit with sessions
2. Add facilitators and mark one as "No Interest" for a specific module
3. Run auto-assignment
4. Download CSV report
5. Verify:
   - Facilitator was not assigned to that module
   - "No Interest" count in CSV is 0

---

## Key Findings

1. ✅ **Constraint is enforced BEFORE assignment**
   - NO_INTEREST facilitators get score of 0.0
   - Only facilitators with score > 0 can be assigned
   
2. ✅ **CSV report is accurate**
   - Shows "No Interest" count (will be 0 if working correctly)
   - Shows per-facilitator skill breakdown
   - Shows individual assignment skill levels

3. ✅ **Fallback behavior is intentional**
   - Facilitators who EXPLICITLY mark NO_INTEREST: blocked
   - Facilitators who HAVEN'T declared skills: allowed (flexible)

4. ✅ **Documentation is accurate**
   - `SCHEDULE_REPORT_README.md` correctly states the constraint
   - CSV report sections match documentation

## Conclusion

✅ **CONFIRMED**: The NO_INTEREST constraint is correctly implemented and properly enforced.

✅ **CONFIRMED**: The CSV report accurately represents this behavior.

No bugs or issues were found. The system is working as designed.
